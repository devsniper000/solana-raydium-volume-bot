# Solana Raydium Volume Bot


You can always feel free to find me here for my help on other projects.

## Key Features

### Version 1
- **Automatic SOL Distribution**: Automatically distribute SOL tokens across multiple wallets to streamline asset management and optimize transaction execution.

- **Multiple Wallet Support**: Seamlessly manage and execute trades across several wallets to diversify strategy and reduce exposure.

- **Token Swapping** Utilize the Raydium SDK or Jupiter API for efficient token swaps, enabling quick and cost-effective trading strategies.

- **Dynamic Trading Intervals**: Buy and sell tokens in random amounts at varying time intervals across multiple wallets, adding an element of unpredictability to trading behavior.

- **Transactions via Jito Mode**: Conduct transactions using Jito mode to enhance efficiency and speed in order execution.

- **Solana Volume Wallet Gathering**: Collect SOL from designated volume wallets to facilitate trading and save up fund.

### Version 2: Enhanced Buyer Strategy
- **Adjust Buying vs. Selling Ratios**: Increase the frequency of purchases to sales, adopting strategies such as 2 purchases for every 1 sale or engaging in 3 purchases at a time, while limiting selling actions to enhance market presence.
- **SOL Collection Post-Transaction**: Gather SOL once remaining tokens in the wallets are sold to optimize asset rotation.

### Version 3: MEV Protection
- **Bundled Transactions**: Safeguard against potential MEV attacks by bundling buy and sell transactions into a single operation, minimizing the risk of front-running.

### Version 4: Strategic Volume Wallet Creation
- **Timed Wallet Deployment**: Create volume wallets at staggered intervals to avoid detection patterns commonly associated with automated, non-human behavior.
- **Targeted Trading Windows**: Conduct buying and selling activities within specific timeframes to further obscure transactional activity from scrutiny.
